Her research interests are centered mostly on neuroplasticity—the possibility of the brain changing for the better, and applications for tools and therapies stemming from these changes, specifically aiming to train attention and memory. Before and during her BA in Cognitive Science at UC Berkeley, she was active in community building and leadership, elected as the youngest student member of the Ohlone College Board of Trustees to date. Sahar co-founded and directed the California Cognitive Science Conference, served as President to multiple organizations, and was granted several awards for leadership excellence. Sahar has also been facilitating a course at Cal teaching Tamarkoz® (Sufi meditation) since 2010. </noclick></span>

He uses computational modeling and machine learning to study the ways in which our internal assumptions affect the way that we perceive and understanding the world around us.  He’d like to think that brains are more similar to computers than we’d all like to imagine, and hopes to discover ways in which we can improve our knowledge of the brain by drawing inspiration from machine learning and computational methods (and vice versa!).

<br>

<br>He is also an avid science writer, blogging, editing, and managing for the Berkeley Science Review, a student-led publication and blog that covers science at Berkeley and Beyond.  He believes that scientists should be skilled communicators as well as researchers, and has a particular love of making complex ideas understandable to everyday people.

<br>

<br>Chris is involved in fundraising and communicating with speakers for the Beyond Academia conference.  He believes that a partnership between academia and the many fantastic organizations in the “real world” is essential for the future progress of science.  There is much that we can learn from each other, and working together is always better than isolation.  

<br>

<br>Chris is a believer in academic science, in industry, and in the everyday person.  He hopes to interact with and contribute to each of these in his career.

He received his PhD at the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam. After obtaining his PhD and before moving to California to pursue his research goals, Arne worked as the Director of the Discovery Festival, a Dutch science festival combining live experiments, art, and new music into a progressive nighttime event.

<br>

<br>He believes science should have a more prominent place in every day life, and more people (of all ages!) should get excited about discovering new things. He also loves organizing events and this has led to him being involved in a host of science communication and outreach events over the years, either professionally (Discovery Festival) or as a volunteer next to his work in the lab (Discovery Festival, Bay Area Science Festival, BASIS, de Young Museum). This also has led him to get involved with Beyond Academia.

<br>

<br>Arne sees the conference as a fantastic opportunity for people to experience the many different and varied options to pursue a science-based career outside of academia. For this year’s conference he is involved with marketing and speaker communication, among other things.</noclick></span>
