He received his doctorate in the lab of James Berger at UC Berkeley, where he studied structure-function relationships at the bacterial replication fork and received the Nicholas Cozzarelli and Harold M. Weintraub graduate student awards. He then computationally designed protein-protein interactions from scratch as a Jane Coffin Childs postdoctoral fellow with David Baker at the University of Washington. In his own lab at Genentech, Jacob is interested in understanding how proteins encode interaction specificity, the design of novel binding partners, and the influence of dynamics upon binding events. Since protein interactions are central to intra- and extracellular communication, uncovering these mechanisms that underly their misregulation is central to understanding disease states.  Jacob’s lab currently focuses on unraveling how the regulation of ubiquitin signaling determines a myriad of cellular processes.</noclick></span>

His research focuses on understanding the processes that create and maintain biodiversity.  Brian uses genomic data such as transcriptomes, reduced representation genomes, and whole genomes to characterize genetic structure of populations, in particular, populations that hybridize. His research gets at the heart of evolution by improving our understanding of the processes that lead to speciation. Brian received a Ph.D. from UC Berkeley’s Integrative Biology department and did postdocs at the Australian Museum in Sydney and at the Joint Genome Institute in Walnut Creek, CA.</noclick></span>

She has a background in physics and science education. She has experience working with large sets of data, especially data coming from technology-enhanced learning environments. Dr. D’Angelo’s postdoctoral work was focused on designing and evaluating quantitative methods to analyze qualitative student data, such as interviews and scientific discourse. Her dissertation work at Arizona State University with Douglas Clark involved looking at how students’ understanding of vectors, vector addition, and Newtonian mechanics was mediated by representations and scaffolding questions in a specially designed physics game called SURGE.</noclick></span>

His work at Exponent weaves together his expertise as a psychologist with the analytical, teaching, and management skills he acquired in academia. He contributes to teams that assess the adequacy of safety information. This work involves analyzing databases to identify patterns of behavior associated with injury. He is also interested in how humans respond to risk communication. He has recently managed projects related to driver distractibility, clothing safety, appliance usage, and automobile purchasing decisions.

<br>Craig’s post-doctoral work at University of California Berkeley examined components of visual working memory retrieval that were sensitive to focal brain lesions and distraction. This NIH funded work was an extension of his dissertation at University of California, Davis, and incorporated data from fMRI and behavioral testing in healthy adults and brain injured patients. He holds a B.S. in Cognitive Science from Carnegie Mellon University.</noclick></span>

During his postdoctoral fellowship in MCB Neurobiology, he applied optogenetics to restore vision in models of severe blindness and used optical reporters, electrophysiology, and in silico modeling to asses visual function following therapeutic intervention. This work led him to invent and develop the BioDriverTM, a novel particle bombardment instrument for targeted intracellular delivery of diverse biologically active molecules into the body.

Insight Fellows are now data scientists at top tech companies like Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, Square and many others. Jake was an entrepreneur in the Y Combinator winter 2011 session and prior to that was a particle physicist at the University of Toronto, working on the Large Hadron Collider experiment. As a panel speaker at Beyond Academia 2013, Jake will provide an introduction to data science and share stories of scientists who have transitioned from academia to the tech industry.</noclick></span>

He received his Ph.D. in integrative neuroscience from UCSF where he studied the influence of norepinephrine on cortical plasticity with Michael Merzenich. As a postdoctoral fellow, Jacob examined the neural mechanisms of expectation and memory and their deterioration during cognitive aging using EEG and fMRI, and developed several novel methods including adaptive liner spatial filtering and complex sources using EEG time series. At Bright, Jacob is on a team of scientists and engineers who are streamlining the labor market via several integrated tools and algorithms, including the Bright Score, a data-driven relevancy algorithm that allows employers to immediately identify the most qualified candidates and helps job seekers immediately find the best available job openings.  He is also the founder of Bright Labs, a destination for reporters and recruiters to gather novel information and analysis of the employment space.</noclick></span>

After an exhaustive job search within academia and beyond, she accepted a job as a data scientist / analyst for the social network Yammer (acquired by Microsoft) and recently became the Director of Data Science for InstaEDU. Now instead of spending her days finding patterns in the large scale structure of galaxies, she finds patterns in the behaviors of people. She'll talk about her transition from astrophysics to tech, compare and contrast the two fields, and give tips about how to land a tech job.</noclick></span>
