Bryan earned his PhD from UC Berkeley studying an unusual sensory blending called synesthesia. While in grad school, he followed his passion for education,and co-founded Mind and Brain Outreach in 2008, which has hosted large collaborative events to teach the mind and brain to thousands of K-12 students in local unrepresented schools in the East Bay. Since assisting Els in founding Beyond Academia in 2013, he has transitioned to his most recent purpose, Mind My Education, which will use mind and brain science to cultivate self-awareness and a sense of purpose in K-12 students in classrooms nationally.

Bryan isn't always this intense. He also loves graphic design and branding, playing music for fun, zen contemplation and Argentine tango.
