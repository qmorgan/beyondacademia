Arne is a Dutch Postdoctoral Fellow working in the Molecular and Cell Biology department, where he studies the adaptive immune system. He received his PhD at the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam. After obtaining his PhD and before moving to California to pursue his research goals, Arne worked as the Director of the Discovery Festival, a Dutch science festival combining live experiments, art, and new music into a progressive nighttime event.

He believes science should have a more prominent place in every day life, and more people (of all ages!) should get excited about discovering new things. He also loves organizing events and this has led to him being involved in a host of science communication and outreach events over the years, either professionally (Discovery Festival) or as a volunteer next to his work in the lab (Discovery Festival, Bay Area Science Festival, BASIS, de Young Museum). This also has led him to get involved with Beyond Academia.

Arne sees the conference as a fantastic opportunity for people to experience the many different and varied options to pursue a science-based career outside of academia. For this yearâ€™s conference he is involved with marketing and speaker communication, among other things.
