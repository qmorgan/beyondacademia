Jacob is a Senior Data Scientist for Bright Media Corporation and Bright.com. He received his Ph.D. in integrative neuroscience from UCSF where he studied the influence of norepinephrine on cortical plasticity with Michael Merzenich. As a postdoctoral fellow, Jacob examined the neural mechanisms of expectation and memory and their deterioration during cognitive aging using EEG and fMRI, and developed several novel methods including adaptive liner spatial filtering and complex sources using EEG time series. At Bright, Jacob is on a team of scientists and engineers who are streamlining the labor market via several integrated tools and algorithms, including the Bright Score, a data-driven relevancy algorithm that allows employers to immediately identify the most qualified candidates and helps job seekers immediately find the best available job openings.  He is also the founder of Bright Labs, a destination for reporters and recruiters to gather novel information and analysis of the employment space.
