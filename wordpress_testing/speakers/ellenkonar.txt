Dr. Konar is a social-organizational psychologist by training and a data scientist and tech industry executive by vocation. Ellen is currently a visiting scholar at the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences and board chair of Mindset Works. 

Ellen was drawn into an emerging tech industry early from academia early in her career by the quick pace and data-driven imperatives of the nascent industry. Her work at industry giants such as Google, Intel and IBM have changed the way these companies acquired and used data to understand and communicate with consumers, manage their brand, and optimize employee and customer happiness. Her team, in collaboration with engineering and product management, garnered the prestigious Google Executive Management Group (EMG) Award. At Intel, she was appointed an Intel Fellow, the first outside the ranks of engineering to receive this honor. She has taught marketing courses at Stanford's Graduate School of Business and Berkeleyâ€™s Haas School of Business and participated in the launch of the Lean In Foundation. 

Dr. Konar received her B.S degree from Case Western Reserve University and MA and PhD in Social Organizational Psychology from SUNY at Buffalo.
