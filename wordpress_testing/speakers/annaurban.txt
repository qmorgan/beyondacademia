Dr. Urban is a Health Scientist with Cardno ChemRisk.  She completed her Ph.D. in Toxicology from the University of Minnesota.  Her primary area of expertise is carcinogenesis and chemoprevention.  Dr. Urbanâ€™s doctoral work focused on elucidating the role of DNA adducts in lung cancer formation.  During her doctoral work she used both in vivo and in vitro models to investigate the formation and repair of DNA adducts following exposure to tobacco-specific nitrosamines.  Dr. Urban also received an MPH in Environmental Health Sciences, during which she developed methods to detect the formation of DNA adducts following exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).  She has extensive experience in the development of analytical techniques for the detection of metabolites and DNA adducts.
