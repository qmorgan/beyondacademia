A Boehringer-Ingelheim Fonds fellow, she has a BA in Biology and a Masters in Neurobiology (Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris). Claire feels strongly about bridging the gap between academic and non-academic career paths. She is excited about bringing Beyond Academia back to Berkeley for the 2nd time.
