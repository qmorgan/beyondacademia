Cynthia D’Angelo, Ph.D., is a researcher specializing in science education, simulations, games, and learning. She is very interested in how we can leverage large amounts of data gathered through online technologies (such as simulations and games) to better understand how it is that students learn science and other STEM concepts and practices. She has a background in physics and science education. She has experience working with large sets of data, especially data coming from technology-enhanced learning environments. Dr. D’Angelo’s postdoctoral work was focused on designing and evaluating quantitative methods to analyze qualitative student data, such as interviews and scientific discourse. Her dissertation work at Arizona State University with Douglas Clark involved looking at how students’ understanding of vectors, vector addition, and Newtonian mechanics was mediated by representations and scaffolding questions in a specially designed physics game called SURGE.
