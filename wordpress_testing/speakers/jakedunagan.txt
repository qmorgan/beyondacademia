Jake's research examines the accelerating transformations of individuals, culture, and governance. In particular, he explores societies are adapting to the Neurocentric age, a time of unprecedented ability to view and modify the mind. Recently, he has written and lectured on comprehensive cognitive design, judicial foresight, kids' technologies, neuroscience and the ocean, alternative energy futures, social media, and the future of work. Jake also designs artifacts, games, immersive experiences of future worlds, and produces guerilla public engagement projects that inject the future into the mental ecology of the present.

Jake received his Ph.D. at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa, where he studied neuropolitics, governance design, alternative futures, and foresight communication. He received an M.A. from Temple University, and a B.A. from Auburn University, both in Visual Anthropology. He is currently an adjunct professor at the California College of Arts' MBA Design Strategy Program, where he teaches Strategic Foresight and  Social Invention.
