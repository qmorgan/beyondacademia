Ken is Chief Scientific Officer at Spiral Devices, a startup company he co-founded in 2010 to develop innovative tools for translational gene therapy and basic neuroscience research. With a strong interest in neurodegeneration, he received his Ph.D. in Vision Science from UC Berkeley in 2007 where he investigated molecular approaches for cell specific gene targeting in the diseased retina using viral vectors. During his postdoctoral fellowship in MCB Neurobiology, he applied optogenetics to restore vision in models of severe blindness and used optical reporters, electrophysiology, and in silico modeling to asses visual function following therapeutic intervention. This work led him to invent and develop the BioDriverTM, a novel particle bombardment instrument for targeted intracellular delivery of diverse biologically active molecules into the body. He has also served as a scientific consultant for Eos Neuroscience and Phoenix Research Labs, and is actively engaged in the QB3 and BayBio startup biotech clusters.
