Els received her PhD in Psychology at UC Berkeley with a research focus on sleep, emotion, and memory. As a Fulbright scholar from the Netherlands, she has authored articles in Current Biology, PNAS, PLos One, and Psychological Bulletin. Els was the founder and lead organizer of the Beyond Academia 2013 conference and now serves a member of the Beyond Academia advisory board. She currently works as a consultant in the Amsterdam office of the strategy and management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.  Els hopes Beyond Academia will continue to help fellow-PhD students and post-docs find their way in the non-academic world.
