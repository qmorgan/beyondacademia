Career Coach

Marty Nemko is living proof there's life after academe. After finishing his PhD at UCB in Ed Psych and then gypsy professoring, including at Cal, Marty found career nirvana as a career coach. The San Francisco Bay Guardian called him, "The Bay Area's Best Career Coach." The former director of California's Employment Development Department wrote an article about him called "California's Favorite Career Coach." And U.S. News called him "job coach extraordinaire." While his clients have included 15 college presidents, he has a special place in his heart for people like himself who are looking for a  life that doesn't require you to publish or perish. But publish he does, although not in journals. After writing a career column in the San Francisco Chronicle for six years, he now writes for USNews.com and AOL.com. In addition to his over 1,000 published articles, he's written seven books, including in 2012, How to Do Life: What They Didn't Teach You In School. He is in his 24th year as host of Work with Marty Nemko on KALW 91.7 FM an NPR station in San Francisco and was the non-member winner of Toastmasters' Northern California Speaker of the Year.
