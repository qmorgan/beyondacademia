Chris Holdgraf is a graduate student in Bob Knight’s cognitive neuroscience laboratory.  He uses computational modeling and machine learning to study the ways in which our internal assumptions affect the way that we perceive and understanding the world around us.  He’d like to think that brains are more similar to computers than we’d all like to imagine, and hopes to discover ways in which we can improve our knowledge of the brain by drawing inspiration from machine learning and computational methods (and vice versa!).

He is also an avid science writer, blogging, editing, and managing for the Berkeley Science Review, a student-led publication and blog that covers science at Berkeley and Beyond.  He believes that scientists should be skilled communicators as well as researchers, and has a particular love of making complex ideas understandable to everyday people.

Chris is involved in fundraising and communicating with speakers for the Beyond Academia conference.  He believes that a partnership between academia and the many fantastic organizations in the “real world” is essential for the future progress of science.  There is much that we can learn from each other, and working together is always better than isolation.  

Chris is a believer in academic science, in industry, and in the everyday person.  He hopes to interact with and contribute to each of these in his career.
