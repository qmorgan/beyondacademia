Brian Simison, Ph.D., is a curator of Comparative Genomics and the Director of the Center for Comparative Genomics at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. His research focuses on understanding the processes that create and maintain biodiversity.  Brian uses genomic data such as transcriptomes, reduced representation genomes, and whole genomes to characterize genetic structure of populations, in particular, populations that hybridize. His research gets at the heart of evolution by improving our understanding of the processes that lead to speciation. Brian received a Ph.D. from UC Berkeleyâ€™s Integrative Biology department and did postdocs at the Australian Museum in Sydney and at the Joint Genome Institute in Walnut Creek, CA.
