Charles received his SB (1988), SM (1992) and PhD (1996) degrees from MIT, all in Electrical Engineering. His graduate research focused on signal processing and feature generation for speech recognition and speaker verification. His first position after graduate school was with early-mid startup Voxware, developing novel algorithms for voice transformation. In 1997 he switched to then mid-startup Nuance, and made a career change from R&D/product development to professional services. He spent 13.5 years in professional services at Nuance, eventually becoming Manager and Director of both functional and geographic-based teams, and working with R&D and Marketing teams to bring advanced technologies such as Natural Language, Call Steering, and Speaker Verification to the marketplace. After spending almost 2 years a small professional services company focusing on deploying speech recognition applications, in September he returned to advanced product development, where he leads natural language and speech recognition development for Gamgee, where their "22otters" platform coaches patients through preparation for medical procedures.
