People look for different things in a job: one person might want to change the world, while another just wants a paycheck. Matching your work personality to the culture of the organization is one of the prime factors in workplace happiness. In this workshop taught by Doug Kalish, PhD, you’ll assess your workplace personality which we will then match against different work environments to see what kinds of organizations are compatible with your work style. We’ll end with a checklist and timeline for starting your job search so that you’ll be fully prepared when the time comes.
