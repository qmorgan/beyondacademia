Elizabeth works at the Public Library of Science (PLOS) as a researcher in the new Labs division headed by Jonathan Dugan. Within the context of open access publishing, she develops and tests new software tools to improve science communication. Elizabeth received her PhD in psychology from UC Berkeley in the spring of 2013. Her dissertation research explored how culture shapes emerging attributional biases in young children. After graduation, she began working as a freelance editor, specializing in academic and scientific editing, including dissertations. Her first project at Labs was to develop an online tool for scientists to quickly and easily evaluate articles in their field. Using research skills from her graduate career, she designed and implemented novel protocols for user experience testing. She works with scientists and science advocates across a wide variety of disciplines to make science research a better process for everyone involved.

Elizabeth was an attendee at the 2013 Beyond Academia conference and is thrilled to be returning as a panelist.
