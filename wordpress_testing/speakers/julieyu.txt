She works in the museumâ€™s Teacher Institute, which provides professional development to middle and high school teachers, and gives content support throughout the museum.  She received her PhD in chemical engineering with a minor in molecular biology from the University of California, Berkeley, but these days prefers doing science in her kitchen, pursuing a tender roast or the perfect souffle.
