Emi graduated from Rice University in 2002 with a bachelors degree in Cognitive Science. She continued on to Northwestern University to pursue a PhD in Neuroscience, focusing on the neural systems involved in memory and learning. In 2008 she joined a lab at the University of California Berkeley as a postdoctoral fellow where she studied the brain network reorganization that occurs after brain injury using MRI and TMS. She has numerous publications in scientific journals including Cerebral Cortex, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience. During her postdoc, Emi developed many of her own analysis tools to supplement existing fMRI analysis packages and to automate much of the image processing. This interest in scientific computing and software development led to her transition to her current position as Data Jockey at Hearsay Social, an enterprise software startup in San Francisco.
