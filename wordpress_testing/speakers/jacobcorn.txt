Jacob is a Scientist at Genentech in the department of Early Discovery Biochemistry.  He received his doctorate in the lab of James Berger at UC Berkeley, where he studied structure-function relationships at the bacterial replication fork and received the Nicholas Cozzarelli and Harold M. Weintraub graduate student awards. He then computationally designed protein-protein interactions from scratch as a Jane Coffin Childs postdoctoral fellow with David Baker at the University of Washington. In his own lab at Genentech, Jacob is interested in understanding how proteins encode interaction specificity, the design of novel binding partners, and the influence of dynamics upon binding events. Since protein interactions are central to intra- and extracellular communication, uncovering these mechanisms that underly their misregulation is central to understanding disease states.  Jacobâ€™s lab currently focuses on unraveling how the regulation of ubiquitin signaling determines a myriad of cellular processes.
