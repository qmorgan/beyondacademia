Kate is the Academic Dean and an Instructor of English at San Francisco University High School, where she has worked for 18 years. She graduated magna cum laude from Brown University with a bachelor’s degree in women’s studies and spent eight years at Cal pursuing a Ph.D. in English before a serendipitous call from the chair of UHS’s English Department sent her career down an unexpected and rewarding new path. In her time at UHS, Kate has designed and taught upper division English electives in topics such as the literature of World War I and gender identity in fiction. She served on the committee that wrote the school’s mission statement, a vision that still guides the institution’s direction more than 10 years later. As an administrator, she led the school’s implementation of a 1:1 iPad program, redesigned the daily schedule, and participated in the creation of the mentoring program, a cutting edge approach to student support currently being studied by researchers at Stanford and Boston University. Kate is looking forward to coming back to Cal to discuss the joys and challenges of independent school work.
