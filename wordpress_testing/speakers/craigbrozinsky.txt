Craig is a scientist in the Human Factors practice at Exponent, an engineering and scientific consulting firm. His work at Exponent weaves together his expertise as a psychologist with the analytical, teaching, and management skills he acquired in academia. He contributes to teams that assess the adequacy of safety information. This work involves analyzing databases to identify patterns of behavior associated with injury. He is also interested in how humans respond to risk communication. He has recently managed projects related to driver distractibility, clothing safety, appliance usage, and automobile purchasing decisions.
Craigâ€™s post-doctoral work at University of California Berkeley examined components of visual working memory retrieval that were sensitive to focal brain lesions and distraction. This NIH funded work was an extension of his dissertation at University of California, Davis, and incorporated data from fMRI and behavioral testing in healthy adults and brain injured patients. He holds a B.S. in Cognitive Science from Carnegie Mellon University.
