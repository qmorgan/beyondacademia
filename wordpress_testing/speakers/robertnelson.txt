Robert Nelson is a CPhil in Modern European History. His research interests concern the building of the building of the surveillance state in 18th Century France. Specifically, Robertâ€™s dissertation focuses on the mechanisms used by the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Comte de Vergennes, to gather information used to manipulate public opinion in France during the American Revolution. Robert is looking forward to a career exploring how technology can better connect academics and their work (particularly those who work in the field of climate studies) with a population that is interested in, and can benefit from academic research. In his spare-time, Robert and his family are trying to conquer the Bay Area's tallest mountain peaks
