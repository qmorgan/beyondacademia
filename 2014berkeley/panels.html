He received his doctorate in the lab of James Berger at UC Berkeley, where he studied structure-function relationships at the bacterial replication fork and received the Nicholas Cozzarelli and Harold M. Weintraub graduate student awards. He then computationally designed protein-protein interactions from scratch as a Jane Coffin Childs postdoctoral fellow with David Baker at the University of Washington. In his own lab at Genentech, Jacob is interested in understanding how proteins encode interaction specificity, the design of novel binding partners, and the influence of dynamics upon binding events. Since protein interactions are central to intra- and extracellular communication, uncovering these mechanisms that underly their misregulation is central to understanding disease states.  Jacob’s lab currently focuses on unraveling how the regulation of ubiquitin signaling determines a myriad of cellular processes.</noclick></span>

His laboratory studies neural mechanisms of perception, attention and memory, with an emphasis on the impact of distraction and multitasking on these abilities. His unique research approach utilizes a powerful combination of human neurophysiological tools, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial stimulation (TES). A major accomplishment of his research has been to expand our understanding of alterations in the aging brain that lead to cognitive decline. His most recent studies explore how we may enhance our cognitive abilities via engagement with custom designed video games, neurofeedback and TES. Dr. Gazzaley has authored over 80 scientific articles, delivered over 300 invited presentations around the world, and his research and perspectives have been consistently profiled in high-impact media, such as The New York Times, New Yorker, Wall Street Journal, TIME, Discover, Wired, PBS, NPR, CNN and NBC Nightly News. Recently, he wrote and hosted the nationally televised, PBS-sponsored special “The Distracted Mind with Dr. Adam Gazzaley”. Awards and honors for his research include the Pfizer/AFAR Innovations in Aging Award, the Ellison Foundation New Scholar Award in Aging, and the Harold Brenner Pepinsky Early Career Award in Neurobehavioral Science.

Haskell and his group support Bayer’s Global Drug Discovery through developing and managing partnerships with U.S. academic research institutions and emerging life science firms, including the master agreement signed with UCSF in 2010. Haskell is also responsible for the development of the CoLaborator, a biotech incubator space adjacent to the company’s U.S. Innovation Center that opened in the fall of 2012 in San Francisco. The CoLaborator houses a number of startup life science firms, and has been developed as a vehicle to foster collaboration between Bayer and these emerging innovators.

<br>

<br>After his graduate work at the University of California, Davis and a postdoctoral fellowship at The Gladstone Institute in San Francisco, Haskell joined the Immunology group at Berlex Biosciences. Since joining Bayer in 2007, Haskell has served in various scientific leadership roles, including the Acting Head of Applied Research, the unit responsible for hemostasis research and drug development. In late 2009, Haskell was named head of Bayer’s newly formed Science Hub.</noclick></span>
